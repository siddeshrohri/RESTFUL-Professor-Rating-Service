## **API Endpoints**  

| Method | Endpoint | Description |  
|--------|----------|-------------|  
| **POST** | `/register/` | User registration |  
| **POST** | `/login/` | User login |  
| **POST** | `/logout/` | User logout |

## **Workflow:**

1. **Start**  
   The process begins.

2. **User Register/Login**  
   The user either registers a new account or logs into an existing one.  
   Authentication happens at this stage.

3. **View Modules**  
   Once logged in, the user can view a list of all available module instances and the professors teaching them.

4. **View Professor Ratings**  
   Alternatively, the user can choose to view the ratings of professors across all modules.

5. **Select Module Instance**  
   If the user chose to view modules, they select a specific module instance (year and semester).

6. **View Professor Rating for Module**  
   If the user selected the view ratings option, they can check the rating for a specific professor in a specific module.

7. **Submit Rating**  
   If the user has selected a module instance, they can submit a rating (from 1-5) for a professor.

8. **Update Professor Average Rating**  
   Once a rating is submitted, the system updates the professor's average rating based on all ratings for that professor.

9. **Store Rating in Database**  
   The rating is stored in the database for future reference.

10. **End**  
    The process ends.

## **Client Application Commands:**

- `login <url>`: Logs the user into the service using their username and password.
- `logout`: Logs the user out of the service.
